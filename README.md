# Mental Health in Technology-related Jobs – ML Supervised Learning Project

## 🧠 Overview
This project supports a pre-emptive HR initiative aimed at mitigating mental health issues in a tech-oriented company. It is based on survey data collected from technology professionals and explores mental health trends, clusters, and characteristics to inform targeted workplace improvements.

 ##  Project Objective
The HR department seeks insights into mental health among employees by:

Reducing the high dimensionality and complexity of the survey data

Identifying and interpreting participant clusters

Visualizing meaningful patterns for targeted HR interventions

## 📊 Dataset
Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016)
Description: Survey data on mental health conditions, attitudes, workplace policies, and personal demographics from tech professionals.

## 💡 Key Steps & Techniques

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Assessed missing values and patterns of incompleteness
Encoded categorical and binary features (e.g., Label Encoding)
Created meaningful numerical representations of qualitative responses
Generated visual overviews (bar charts, correlation matrices) for key variables

### Feature Selection & Extraction:
Chi-Square Test
ANOVA (f_classif)
Mutual Information
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)

### Clustering:
KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering
Cluster evaluation (Silhouette Score)

### Visualization:
Variance explained (PCA)
Cluster heatmaps and scatter plots (2D/3D)
Feature impact interpretation

## ⚙️ How to Run
Clone this repository
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebooks to follow the analysis step-by-step

## 📌 Future Improvements
Integrate supervised learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) for mental health risk prediction

Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit or Dash) for HR reporting and scenario testing

Expand to time-series or longitudinal survey data for monitoring employee wellness over time
